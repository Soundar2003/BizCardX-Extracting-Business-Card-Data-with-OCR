**Project Title:** BizCardX: Extracting Business Card Data with OCR

**Technologies:**

* Python
* OCR (easyOCR)
* Streamlit (GUI library)
* SQL (database management)
* Image processing

**Problem Statement:**

Develop a Streamlit application that:

* Allows users to upload business card images
* Extracts relevant information using easyOCR (company name, card holder name, designation, mobile number, email address, website URL, area, city, state, pin code)
* Displays extracted information in a user-friendly GUI
* Saves extracted information and images to a database (SQLite or MySQL)
* Provides CRUD functionalities (Create, Read, Update, Delete) within the Streamlit UI
  
**Approach:**

**Installation:**

* Install Python, Streamlit, easyOCR, and a database management system (SQLite or MySQL).

**User Interface Design:**

* Create a user-friendly Streamlit interface:
* File uploader for business card images
* Buttons for processing, saving, and CRUD operations
* Text boxes for displaying extracted information

**Image Processing and OCR:**

* Use easyOCR to extract information from uploaded images.
* Preprocess images (resizing, cropping, thresholding) if necessary to enhance quality for OCR.

**Information Display:**

* Present extracted information in a clear and organized manner using Streamlit widgets (tables, text boxes, labels).

**Database Integration:**

* Use SQLite or MySQL to store extracted information and images.
* Implement CRUD operations through Streamlit UI using SQL queries.

**Testing:**

* Thoroughly test all application functionalities to ensure expected behavior.

**Improvement:**

* Continuously enhance the application through:
* Code optimization
* Bug fixes

**Results:**

* A functional Streamlit application for business card information extraction and management.
* User-friendly interface for image uploading, information extraction, and database interactions.
* Efficient OCR using easyOCR.
* Robust database storage and management.
* Potential for further enhancements and customization.
